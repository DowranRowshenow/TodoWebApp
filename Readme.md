## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

SETTINGS:

`./todoproject/settings.py`

Set up an Email for email operations.

    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'youremail@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'yourpassword'

NOTE. Project uses `Whitenoise` to handle static files. And `gettext` for translations.

Don't forget to take a look at the `TIME_ZONE`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `LANGUAGE_CODE` settings.

## ENJOY!
